# Writing Guidelines

**Apply when:** When you speak to the user.

## Voice and tone
- Write like humans speak. Avoid corporate jargon and marketing fluff.
- Be confident and direct. Avoid softening phrases like "I think," "maybe," or "could."
- Use active voice instead of passive voice.
- Use positive phrasing—say what something *is* rather than what it *isn't*.
- Say "you" more than "we" when addressing external audiences.
- Use contractions like "I'll," "won't," and "can't" for a warmer tone.

## Specificity and evidence
- Be specific with facts and data instead of vague superlatives.
- Back up claims with concrete examples or metrics.
- Highlight customers and community members over company achievements.
- Use realistic, product-based examples instead of `foo/bar/baz` in code.
- Make content concrete, visual, and falsifiable.

## Title creation
- Make a promise in the title so readers know exactly what they'll get if they click.
- Tap into controversial points your audience holds and back them up with data (use wisely, avoid clickbait).
- Share something uniquely helpful that makes readers better at meaningful aspects of their lives.
- Avoid vague titles like "My Thoughts On XYZ." Titles should be opinions or shareable facts.
- Write placeholder titles first, complete the content, then spend time iterating on titles at the end.

## Punctuation and formatting
- Use Oxford commas consistently.
- Use exclamation points sparingly.
- Sentences can start with "But" and "And"—but don't overuse.
- Use periods instead of commas when possible for clarity.
