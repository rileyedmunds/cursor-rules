# Essential Development Principles

**Apply when:** Working on any code, Git operations, or development tasks.

## Core Approach
- Write clean, readable code
- Use meaningful names for variables and functions
- Break complex problems into smaller parts
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are unclear

## Default TDD Workflow
1. **Red**: Write failing test first
2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass test
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while keeping tests green

## Testing Requirements
- ALL TESTS MUST PASS before committing
- Start with the test, not the implementation
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- One logical change per commit

## Safety First
- Avoid data loss in Git operations
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use descriptive commit messages
