## Advanced TDD Techniques
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing
- Use test doubles (stubs, spies, mocks)
- Property-based testing for edge cases
- Test pyramids: unit > integration > e2e

## TDD Patterns
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Given-When-Then for BDD
- Test data builders for complex objects
- Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios

## Testing Strategies
- Outside-in TDD (start with acceptance tests)
- Inside-out TDD (start with unit tests)
- Test-driven refactoring
- Legacy code testing techniques
