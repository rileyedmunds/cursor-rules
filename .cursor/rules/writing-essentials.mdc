# Writing Essentials

**Apply when:** User asks about writing, documentation, or content creation.

## Voice & Tone
- Write like humans speak, avoid corporate jargon
- Be confident and direct, avoid hedging
- Use active voice, positive phrasing
- Use contractions for warmth

## Clarity
- Be specific with facts and data
- Use concrete examples, not `foo/bar/baz`
- Make content concrete and falsifiable

## Common Fixes
- `assistance` → "help"
- `attempt` → "try" 
- `facilitate` → "help" or "ease"
- `leverage` → "use"
- `utilize` → "use"
- `a bit/a little` → remove
- `pretty/quite/really/very` → remove
