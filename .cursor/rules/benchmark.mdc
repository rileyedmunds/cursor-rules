**Apply when:** User mentions benchmarking, performance testing, or running large test suites.

Always validate components work with minimal test data before running comprehensive benchmarks:

1. UNIT TEST FIRST: Test each function with 1 example (< 5 seconds)
2. SMOKE TEST: Run 1 complete query through full pipeline (< 10 seconds)  
3. MINI BENCHMARK: Test 10 questions with 1 model (< 2 minutes)
4. TARGETED FIX: If errors found, test fix with specific failing case (< 30 seconds)
5. FULL BENCHMARK: Only run complete suite when confident (< 30 minutes)

Never run long tests without validating the pipeline works on small data first.
