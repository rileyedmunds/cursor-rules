# Git Workflow Essentials

**Apply when:** User asks about Git, commits, branches, or version control.

## Core Principles
- Always work on feature/topic branches, never commit directly to main
- Use descriptive branch names: `feature/user-auth`, `bugfix/login-error`, `chore/update-deps`
- Write clear commit messages in present tense: `feat: add user login`
- Run tests before every commit
- Use `git switch` and `git restore` (modern alternatives to checkout)

## Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - new features
- `bugfix/description` - bug fixes  
- `chore/description` - maintenance tasks
- `test/description` - test-focused changes

## Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): description

Types: feat, fix, test, refactor, docs, style, perf, chore
Example: feat(auth): implement JWT validation
```
